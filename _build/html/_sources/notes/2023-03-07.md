# Intro to ML & Naive Bayes



We're going to approach machine learning from the perspective of *modeling* for
a few reasons:
- model based machine learning streamlines understanding the big picture
- the model way of interpreting it aligns well with using sklearn
- thinking in terms of models aligns with incorporating domain expertise, as in our data science definition


this [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bishop-MBML-2012.pdf) by Christopher M. Bishop, a pioneering ML researcher who also wrote one of a the widely preferred
graduate level ML textbooks, details advantages of a model based perspective and
a more mathematical version of a model based approach to machine learning. He is a co-author on an introductory [model based ML](https://mbmlbook.com/toc.html)



In CSC461: Machine Learning, you can encounter an *algorithm* focused approach
to machine learning, but I think having the model based perspective first helps
you avoid common pitfalls.



## What is a Model?

A model is a simplified representation of some part of the world. A famous quote about models is:



All models are wrong, but some are useful
--[George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)[^wiki]
---

In machine learning, we use models, that are generally _statistical_ models.
---
A statistical model is a mathematical model that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data (and similar data from a larger population). A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model#:~:text=A%20statistical%20model%20is%20a,%2C%20the%20data%2Dgenerating%20process.)

## Models in Machine Learning
---
Starting from a dataset, we first make an additional designation about how we will use the different variables (columns). We will call most of them the _features_, which we denote mathematically with $\mathbf{X}$ and we'll choose one to be the _target_ or _labels_, denoted by $\mathbf{y}$.
---
The core assumption for just about all machine learning is that there exists some function $f$ so that for the $i$th sample

$$
  y_i = f(\mathbf{x}_i)
$$
---
$i$ would be the index of a DataFrame
---


---
## Types of Machine Learning

Then with different additional assumptions we get different types of machine learning:
- if both features ($\mathbf{X}$) and target ($\mathbf{y}$) are observed (contained in our dataset) it's [__supervised learning__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) [code](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html)
- if only the features ($\mathbf{X}$) are observed, it's [__unsupervised learning__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) [code](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html)

---
## Supervised Learning

we'll focus on supervised learning first.  we can take that same core assumption and use it with additional information about our target variable to determine learning __task__ we are working to do.

$$
  y_i = f(\mathbf{x}_i)
$$

- if $y_i$ are discrete (eg flower species) we are doing __classification__
- if $y_i$ are continuous (eg height) we are doing __regression__

---
## Machine Learning Pipeline

To do machine learning we start with __training data__ which we put as input to the __learning algorithm__. A learning algorithm might be a generic optimization procedure or a specialized procedure for a specific model. The learning algorithm outputs a trained __model__ or the parameters of the model. When we deploy a model we pair the __fit model__ with a __prediction algorithm__ or __decision__ algorithm to evaluate a new sample in the world.

In experimenting and design, we need __testing data__ to evaluate how well our learning algorithm understood the world.  We need to use previously unseen data, because if we don't we can't tell if the prediction algorithm is using a rule that the learning algorithm produced or just looking up from a lookup table the result.  This can be thought of like the difference between memorization and understanding.

When the model does well on the training data, but not on test data, we say that it does not generalize well.

## Let's Practice:

 First machine learning model: Naive bayes
```{code-cell} ipython3
%matplotlib inline
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report, roc_auc_score
iris_df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
```
To start we will look at the data
```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_df.head(1)
```

And notice that there are equal number of samples for each value of the species. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_df['species'].value_counts()
```

![image of an iris with the petal width, petal length, sepal length and sepal width annotated](https://www.integratedots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iris_petal-sepal-e1560211020463.png)

We're trying to build an automatic flower classifier that, for measurements of a new flower returns the predicted species. To do this, we have a DataFrame with columns for species, petal width, petal length, sepal length, and sepal width. The species is what type of flower it is the petal and sepal are parts of the flower. 

The species will be the target and the measurements will be the features.  We want to predict the target from the features, the species from the measurements. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
feature_vars = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width','petal_length', 'petal_width',]
target_var = 'species'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris_df[feature_vars],iris_df[target_var],random_state=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
X_train.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
X_test.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
112/150
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.pairplot(iris_df,hue='species')
```



## What does Naive Bayes do?

[docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html)


Naive = indepdent features
Bayes = most probable

[Bayes Estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_estimator)
```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb = GaussianNB()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(gnb)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.__dict__
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.fit(X_train,y_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.__dict__
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.score(X_test, y_test)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_pred[:3]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_test[:3]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
confusion_matrix(y_test,y_pred)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(classification_report(y_test,y_pred))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sum(y_pred ==y_test)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
37/len(y_test)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_train_pred = gnb.predict(X_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sum(y_train_pred == y_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(y_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
