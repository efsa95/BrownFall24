# Pandas and Indexing

## Iterable types
```{code-cell} ipython3
a = [char for char in 'abcde']
b = {char:i for i,char in enumerate('abcde')}
c = ('a','b','c','d','e')
d = 'a b c d e'.split()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(a)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
b
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(b)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(c)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
d
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(d)
```

## Reading data other ways

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
course_comms_url = 'https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownSpring23/syllabus/communication.html'
```

THis reads in from the html directly. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_html(course_comms_url)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
html_list = pd.read_html(course_comms_url)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(html_list)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(html_list[0])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
[type(h) for h in html_list]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
achievements_url = 'https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownSpring23/syllabus/achievements.html'
```

get the tables

```{code-cell} ipython3
achievements_df_list = pd.read_html(achievements_url)
```

make a list means use a list comprehension

```{code-cell} ipython3
[ach.shape for ach in achievements_df_list]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
achievements_df_list.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(coffee_data_url,index_col=0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head(1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Species'].head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(coffee_df['Species'])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Number.of.Bags']
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
new_values = {0:'<100',1:'100-199',2:'200-299',3:'300+'}
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
[new_values[int(num/100)] for num in coffee_df['Number.of.Bags']]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
bags_bin = lambda num: int(num/100)
[new_values[bags_bin(num)] for num in coffee_df['Number.of.Bags']]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(pd.read_csv)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(bags_bin)
```

## Importing locally

If I make a file in the same folder as my notebook called `example.py`
and then put 
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
%%bash
cat example.py
```
in the file, we can use that file like: 

```{code-cell} ipython3
from example import name
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
name
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import example
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
example.name
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

## Questions After Class

### why does casting the int over the (num/100) give you the right number? Is it because of floor division?

First let's look at an interim value, lets pick a value for `num`
```{code-cell} ipython3
num = 307
```

Then do the calculation without casting to int 

```{code-cell} ipython3
num/100
```

Remember that `int` type is an integer or whole number, no fraction.  So, casting drops the decimal part. 


###  How would adding 2 DataFrametogether of separate types affect the type command?

It depends what "add" means.  If addition it might error, but if it worked, then it would still be a DataFrame. If stacking with `pd.concat` it would also be a DatFrame. 

If you make them into a list, then the would be a list. 



### what keys to use in the dictionaries?
In the assignment the instruction say

### how to save as a local csv file?

[pandas.DataFrame.to_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html)

### how to create a Dataframe?

Use the [constructor](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)


### how to read using relative path?

A relative path can work just like a URL. [read about them here](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-path-absolute-relativehttps://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-path-absolute-relative)

### I would like to know about other common forms of data files.

The pandas documentation's [I/O](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html) page is where I recommend starting

## What other libraries do we end up using?

Next week we will use `seaborn` for plotting. Later in the semester we will use `sklearn` for machine learning.  We will use a few other libaries for a few features, but these three are the main ones.
