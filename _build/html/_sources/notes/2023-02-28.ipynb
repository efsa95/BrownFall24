    "# Evaluating ML Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we are going to start learning about machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to do this by looking at how to tell if machine learning has worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because:\n",
    "- you have to check if one worked after you build one\n",
    "- if you do not check carefully, it might only sometimes work\n",
    "- gives you a chance to learn *only* evaluation instead of evaluation + an ML task\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Machine Learning Algorithm? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what is an Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "> An algorithm is a set of ordered steps to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when people outside of CS talk about algorithms that impact people's lives these are often *not written directly by people* anymore.  THey are often the result of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, people write an algorithm for how to write an algorithm based on data.  This often comes in the form of a statitistical model of some sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ml overview: training data goes into the learning algorithm, which outputs the prediction algorithm. the prediciton algorithm takes a sampleand outputs a prediction](../img/MLdataflow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we *do* machine learning, this can also be called:\n",
    "- data mining\n",
    "- pattern recognition\n",
    "- modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "because we are looking for patterns in the data and typically then planning to\n",
    "use those patterns to make predictions or automate a task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these terms does have slightly different meanings and usage, but\n",
    "sometimes they're used close to exchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can we tell if ML is working?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We measure the performance of the prediction algorithm, to determine if the learning algorithm worked. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Replicating the COMPAS Audit\n",
    "We are going to replicate the audit from ProPublica [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why COMPAS?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Propublica started the COMPAS Debate with the article [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencin).  With their article, they also released details of their methodology and their [data and code](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis).  This presents a real data set that can be used for research on how data is used in a criminal justice setting without researchers having to perform their own requests for information, so it has been used and reused a lot of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Propublica COMPAS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of COMPAS scores assigned to defendants over two years 2013-2014 in Broward County, Florida, it was released by Propublica in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/). These scores are determined by a proprietary algorithm designed to evaluate a persons recidivism risk - the likelihood that they will reoffend. Risk scoring algorithms are widely used by judges to inform their sentencing and bail decisions in the criminal justice system in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The journalists collected, for each person arreste din 2013 and 2014:\n",
    "- basic demographics\n",
    "- details about what they were charged with and priors\n",
    "- the COMPAS score assigned to them\n",
    "- if they had actually been re-arrested within 2 years of their arrest\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we have what the COMPAS algorithm predicted (in the form of a score from 1-10) and what actually happened (re-arrested or not). We can then measure how well the algorithm worked, in practice, in the real world."
