# This section of the site has a set of portfolio prompts and this page has instructions for portfolio submissions.  
# 
# Starting in week 3 it is recommended that you spend some time each week working on items for your portfolio, that way when it's time to submit you only have a little bit to add before submission.
# 
# The portfolio is your only chance to earn Level 3 achievements, however, if you have not earned a level 2 for any of the skills in a given check, you could earn level 2 then instead.
# The prompts provide a starting point, but remember that to earn achievements, you'll be evaluated by the rubric.
# You can see the full rubric for all portfolios in the [syllabus](portfolioskills).
# Your portfolio is also an opportunity to be creative, explore things, and answer your own questions that we haven't answered in class to dig deeper on the topics we're covering.
# Use the feedback you get on assignments to inspire your portfolio.
# 
# Each submission should include an introduction and a number of 'chapters'.  The grade will be based on both that you demonstrate skills through your chapters that are inspired by the prompts and that your summary demonstrates that you *know* you learned the skills. See the [formatting tips](formatting) for advice on how to structure files.
# 
# 
# On each chapter(for a file) of your portfolio, you should identify which skills by their keyword, you are applying.
#
