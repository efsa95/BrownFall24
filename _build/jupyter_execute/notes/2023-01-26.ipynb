    "## Questions After Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is indentation important in python but not other languages like C++?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a newer language than C and C++.  Older languages had to contend with the fact that a space character uses the same amount of memory as any other character, so they were not used.  However, whitespace is easy to read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was started in [1989](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place), compared to C in [1972](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6499601), C++ was started in 1985ish, but stuck with a lot of things from C, so tht 1972 is strongly operative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is designed to be easy. It is designed to make complex tasks easier to do.  C is designed to be efficient and to compeile well, even if it is hard to learn and do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why is python so much slower as well?\n",
    "Python is slower because it is an interpreted language. That means another program called the Python interpreter (which mostly are written in C) is actually running on your computer, that program parses the text of your source code and then executes the code. The interpreter cannot look ahead and change things in how you wrote your code while it runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, C++ (like C) is a compiled language.  This means that a program called a compiler parses your code and translates it into assembly then to machine code. During this process it can optimize your code to make sure that it is fast.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Are portfolios simply whatever we submit, such as assignments, to Github or are there other things that need to be submitted to the portfolios for level 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments are separate from the portfolio checks.  It will become more clear what to do in your portfolio after you get feedback on assignment 2, and start working on assignment 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Will we know the specific criteria to fulfill a level 3 achievement when doing the portfolio?\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation criteria are already listed on the [](checklists). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### when is the Assignment 1 due?\n",
    "\n",
    "Monday, end of day. See the details: [](../assignments/01-syllabus-install)\n",
    "\n",
    "### how many large scale programs are we going to write in jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't actually write large scale programs, per se, but we will write some long analyses."
