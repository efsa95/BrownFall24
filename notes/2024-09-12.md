# Pandas Data Frames and More Iterable Types

```{note}
I was able to fix my certificate problem by running
[this script](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/560ea272b01acaa6c531cc7d94331b2ef0854be6/Mac/BuildScript/resources/install_certificates.command) from the python install.  
```

We will import pandas 

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

We want to import the coffee data and we will keep working with it over several classes.  Sometimes we want to put functions we have written or constants like this in a module of our own that we can import.  For today we will put the following in a file called `coffee.py`

```Python
robusta_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
robusta_data_file = 'robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
```

Now we can import it

```{code-cell} ipython3
import coffee
```

and use the variable with a `.`, as an attribute of the module. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee.robusta_data_url
```

We could also import the variables directly so that we can use 
them without the `.`

```{code-cell} ipython3
from coffee import robusta_data_url, robusta_data_file
```

like follows
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["raises-exception"]
ro
```

This is a `NameError` because the variable does not exist. 

When we spell it correctly, it works as desired. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
robusta_data_url
```

Then we can use the variable. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(robusta_data_url)
```

## DataFrame parts

first we will check the type

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(coffee_df)
```

we saw that we can check the first 5 rows with `head` 
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head()
```

and `tail` to see the last ones. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.tail(3)
```

We note that one of the columns is named `Unnamed 0:` because it does not have a name in the file, for that column. 

We can use {kbd}`shift` + {kbd}`tab` to see help.  We see that the [`index_col` parameter](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#:~:text=are%20not%20allowed.-,index_col,-Hashable%2C%20Sequence%20of) to treat that column as the index. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(robusta_data_url,index_col=0)
coffee_df.head(1)
```

### Data Frame parts 

Now it looks neater and tht columns is the index. 

We saw before the columns
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.columns
```

The rows are named by the `index` attribute
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.index
```

Both of these are pandas [Index objects](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/indexing.html)


We can also take out only the values without the index or the column names. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.values
```
(numpyarrayvalues)=
this is a `numpy.array` type

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(coffee_df.values)
```


### Segmenting rows or columns
 We can pick out a column using it's name and `[]`



```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Flavor']
```

this is a pandas [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/series.html)

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(coffee_df['Flavor'])
```

We can pick a row out with [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html), the property that grabs a row by its name, a value from the index. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.loc[7]
```

this is also a series. 

(masking)=
### Masking to Select Subsets

We can use a boolean mask or Series with boolean values, to pick out a subset of rows.  

To build up to that, we will first evaluate a boolean expression on a column. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Flavor']>7.8
```

Now, we can save it to a variable, and then use it to mask, by treating it as an index. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
high_flavor = coffee_df['Flavor']>7.8
coffee_df[high_flavor]
```

this segments out only the selected rows. 

The values are a numpy array which also has the same shape as the datafram, but it does not incude the index or the column headers (which do not count as rows or columns anyway)

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_vals = coffee_df.values
```

We can see this with the shape attribute

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_vals.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.shape
```

## Reading from a website

We saw in the help that pandas has a lot of `read_` methods.  You can also see a list on the [IO page of the docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/io.html#)

```{code-cell} ipython3
achievements_url = 'https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall24/syllabus/achievements.html'
```

We can read from html files (websites)
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_html(achievements_url,)
```

this does not look like the others, it is a list of the DataFrames for all of the tables on the page. Even if there is only one, it will still be in a list. 

Now that we know it is a list, we will save it in a variable and then, pick out one DataFrame. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
ach_df_list = pd.read_html(achievements_url,)
ach_defn = ach_df_list[2]
```

we can pick out the one and check that it is indeed a dataFrame

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(ach_defn)
```


## Slicing 

We will use a small list to practice slicing, but it works the same in a DataFrame.

```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list = [3,4,5,6]
```

we can get the last item with `-1`

```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list[-1]
```

We can use `:` to go up to, but not including a particular point. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list[:2]
```

Note that using `2` picks out the value in position 2, but the above stopped before that. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list[2]
```

we can slice from the right, but this time it is inclusive

```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list[-2:]
```

we can put numbers on both sides of the `:` to take a segment out

```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list[1:3]
```

we can use two to specify an interval at which to pick values. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list[::2]
```

or we can state the starting point with it

```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_list[1::2]
```

## Built in iterable types

These are four different iterable constructions: 
```{code-cell} ipython3
a = [char for char in 'abcde']
b =  {char:i for i, char in enumerate('abcde')}
c = ('a','b','c','d','e')
d = 'a b c d e'.split(' ')
```

We can see their types
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(a), type(b), type(c), type(d)
```

Dictionaries are really useful because they consist of key, value pairs.  This is really powerful and we will use it a lot to pass complex structures into functions. 


we can make another one more manually that is much ike the above. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
sample_dict = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}
sample_dict
```

we access values of a dicationary using the key
```{code-cell} ipython3
sample_dict['a']
```

we can iterate over them using the `items` method to pop them off separately. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
for char,num in sample_dict.items():
    print('char', char, 'is linked to number',num)
```

## Saving an excerpt

We can find the rows only with a small `Number.of.Bags`, say <100:


```{code-cell} ipython3
small_batch_mask = coffee_df['Number.of.Bags']<100
small_batch = coffee_df[small_batch_mask]
```

After we make the mask, then subset the data, we see its a dataframe

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(small_batch)
```

and then we can save it to csv. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
small_batch.to_csv('robusta_small_batch.csv')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
