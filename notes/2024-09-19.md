# Visualization

Data Visualization is about using plots, to convey informaiton and get a better understanding of the data. 



## Plotting in Python

There are several popular plotting libaries:
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): low level plotting tools
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html): high level plotting with opinionated defaults
- [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/): plotting based on the ggplot library in R.

Plus pandas has a `plot` method

Pandas and seaborn use matplotlib under the hood.

Seaborn and ggplot both assume the data is set up as a DataFrame.
Getting started with seaborn is the simplest, so we'll use that.

[figure vs axes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/function_overview.html#relative-merits-of-figure-level-functions)

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
carbon_data_url = 'https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/raw/master/data/2024/2024-05-21/emissions.csv'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
carbon_df = pd.read_csv(carbon_data_url)
carbon_df['commodity_simple'] = carbon_df['commodity'].apply(lambda s: s if not('Coal' in s) else 'Coal')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
carbon_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
carbon_df['year'].value_counts()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
carbon_df['year'].plot(kind='hist')
```

![summary of plot types](https://seaborn.pydata.org/_images/function_overview_8_0.png)

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=carbon_df,x='commodity_simple', y='total_emissions_MtCO2e')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=carbon_df,x='commodity_simple', y='total_emissions_MtCO2e',kind='bar')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=carbon_df,x='commodity_simple', y='total_emissions_MtCO2e',kind='bar',
           col = 'parent_type')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.set_palette('colorblind')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=carbon_df,x='commodity_simple', y='total_emissions_MtCO2e',kind='bar',
           col = 'parent_type',hue='commodity_simple')
```

Example q:
- which parent type has te most constent emissins across commodity type?
- which parent type has highest emission?
- which is highest?

+++

## Emissions over time?

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.relplot(data=carbon_df, x='year', y='total_emissions_MtCO2e',
           hue ='parent_entity',row ='parent_type')
```


## Variable types and data types

Related but not the same.

+++

Data types are literal, related to the representation in the computer.

ther can be `int16, int32, int64`

+++

We can also have mathematical types of numbers

- Integers can be positive, 0, or negative.
- Reals are continuous, infinite possibilities.
+++
Variable types are about the meaning in a conceptual sense.

- categorical (can take a discrete number of values, could be used to group data,
  could be a string or integer; unordered)
- continuous (can take on any possible value, always a number)
- binary (like data type boolean, but could be represented as yes/no, true/false,
  or 1/0, could be categorical also, but often makes sense to calculate rates)
- ordinal (ordered, but appropriately categorical)

we'll focus on the first two most of the time. Some values that are technically
only integers range high enough that we treat them more like continuous most of
the time.


```{code-cell} ipython3
carbon_df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

## Questions After Class

Class Response Summary:



### To what degree should we be familiarizing ourselves with these different kinds of graphs?

There is also a full semester data visualization class, so we will not cover *everything* it is useful to know a few basic ones and we will look to see that you can create and correctly interpret at least 3 different kinds. 

### Should I upload all parts of A2 today if I plan to go to office hours tomorrow? Or just the finished parts?

All of it with your questions written in the file(s). 

### is there ways to overlap the different parent types into the same graph?

This is called a stacked bar graph, there are examples in the seaborn tutorials for [displot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/distributions.html#:~:text=Alternatively%2C%20instead%20of%20layering%20each%20bar%2C%20they%20can%20be%20%E2%80%9Cstacked%E2%80%9D%2C%20or%20moved%20vertically.%20In%20this%20plot%2C%20the%20outline%20of%20the%20full%20histogram%20will%20match%20the%20plot%20with%20only%20a%20single%20variable%3A) but with an important caveat that that can make some things hard to see and you can also [stack with the low level features](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.objects.Stack.html)

### is the ggplot option just the same method names as the version in R? or is the syntax updated to be similar also?

I think its mostly matching method names, attribute names,  and conceptual ideas. Python libraries all have to use Python syntax. 

### Is the peer review just for assignment 3 or will we have the option to do it for future assignments?

Probably only 3, but possibly a couple more. 



### What is the typical range of sizes for a good dataset for this assignment

hundred to maybe 2000, you do not need more than that and too many can make it slow

### if we don't get any achievements on an assignment are we able to revise them to get an achievement?

If you are very close, yes, if you are not very close, you will get advice that we recommend you apply on future assignments. 


### What is a numpy array?

A DataType that one of the attributes of a DataFrame takes. See the glossary entry for {term}`numpy array` 
and the [intro to DataFrames]()
